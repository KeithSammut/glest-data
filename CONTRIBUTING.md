# Contributing to the Glest data repository

Thank you your interest in this project!

This repo mainly holds data used by [Glest](https://glest.io).

The guidelines for contributing are the same for the [Glest source
code](https://github.com/Glest/glest-source), and can be found
in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Glest/glest-source/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
(link leads to a different repository in the [Glest
organization](https://github.com/Glest)). That document also
contains the instructions for performing pull requests.
